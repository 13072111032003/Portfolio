    <h1>We are <strong>Fer Rend√≥n and Eliecer Palma</strong></h1>
    <h3>We are engineering students in information technologies</h3>
    <p>Many times in life we think and even say that we want to die. But life is too valuable to waste. 
      We are all very important. Think that even if you are nobody to the world, to someone you are the world. 
      Many times we think that others are perfect, but there is no one perfect, we are all the same. There are 
      only people who have things that you don't have, like you have things that they don't have. Many times you 
      feel bad about the way you act and react, but what happens is that some of us hurt more easily than others. 
      The virtues of others are always more visible to you than your own. Many times you cling to something or 
      someone. It's not bad, but try not to make it essential for your life, if you get used to always using 
      crutches, you'll never walk well. Many times you despise yourself, you look in the mirror and insult yourself. Don't do it, accept both your reality and the fact that only God can transform your life.</p>
